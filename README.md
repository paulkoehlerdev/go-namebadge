# go-namebadge

A small, hacked-together Go project for controlling a generic LED matrix namebadge (specifically the S1144 model). This project was created as a quick hacking project during the 38c3 conference. It’s not meant for production use, but serves as a reference for working with LED matrices and interfacing with hardware using Go.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is intentionally minimalistic and lacks a user interface.

## Features

- Control an LED matrix badge (S1144 model) with Go.
- Allows for basic control and manipulation of the LED matrix.
- Designed as a reference and hacking project, not a polished tool.
